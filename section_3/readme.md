![view here](architecture_design.png)

### These are following AWS services to design the solution:

#### IAM (Identity and Access Management): 
is AWSâ€™s service for securely managing users, groups, and permissions to control access to cloud resources.

#### Amazon CloudWatch: 
is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events to provide real-time insights into AWS resources, applications, and infrastructure.

#### AWS CodePipeline (CI/CD): 
is an automated continuous integration and deployment to streamline updates and enhancements.

#### AWS CloudTrail: 
is a service that records, monitors, and audits all API calls and account activity across your AWS environment for security and compliance.

#### AWS Secrets Manager: 
is a service that securely stores, manages, and rotates sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and tokens to protect access to applications and resources.

#### AWS Key Management Service (KMS): 
is a managed service that creates, manages, and controls cryptographic keys to securely encrypt and decrypt data across AWS services and applications.

#### Amazon GuardDuty: 
is a threat detection service that continuously monitors AWS accounts, workloads, and data for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.

#### AWS CodePipeline: 
is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the build, test, and deployment stages of application and infrastructure updates.
